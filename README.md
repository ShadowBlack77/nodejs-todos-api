Welcome to my NodeJS Todos API project! Here you will find the entire project created in NodeJS using TypeScript and several other libraries widely used in many projects. The project is created with the Backend in mind and the best use of NodeJS technology and best practices in project creation, but I also added a very simple Frontend that will help visualize the operation of the API. The frontend is created in Angular technology and includes several functions:
- Login
- Registration
- Logout
- Guards
- Interceptors (Automatically refreshing the token and attaching cookies with the header)
- Todos CRUD
- Architecture allowing for huge expansion
- TailwindCSS
- GSAP
